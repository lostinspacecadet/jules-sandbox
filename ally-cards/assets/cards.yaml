  scenario: >
    Someone makes a biased or stereotypical comment.
  advice: >
    Privately, if you feel safer: 'That comment made me uncomfortable.
    Here's why...' Publicly, if appropriate: 'Can you clarify what

  scenario: >
    A task is consistently assigned to people based on stereotypes
    (e.g., women asked to take notes).
  advice: >
    Suggest a rotation system for such tasks. Or volunteer: 'I can
    take notes this time.' If it's a pattern, consider discussing
    with a manager or HR.

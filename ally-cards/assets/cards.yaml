  scenario: >
    Someone is interrupted or spoken over
  advice: >
    Say: 'I'd like to hear what [interrupted person] was saying.'
    Or 'Hold on, let [interrupted person] finish their thought.'

- id: 2
  scenario: >
    An idea from one person is ignored, but later praised
    when suggested by someone else
  advice: >
    Say: 'Thanks for surfacing that. I recall [original person] made
    a similar point earlier. [Original person], did you want to elaborate?'

- id: 3
  scenario: >
    Someone makes a biased or stereotypical comment
  advice: >
    Privately, if you feel safer: 'That comment made me uncomfortable.
    Here's why...' Publicly, if appropriate: 'Can you clarify what
    you meant by that?' or 'Let's be mindful of using inclusive language.'

  scenario: >
    A task is consistently assigned to people based on stereotypes
  advice: >
    Suggest a rotation system for such tasks. Or volunteer: for example, 'I can
    take notes this time.' If it's a pattern, consider discussing
    with a manager or HR.

  scenario: >
    A meeting is taken over by a non-organiser, for their own benefit or agenda
  advice: >
    Say: 'Let's refocus on the original purpose of this meeting.'
    Or: 'I'd like to hear from [organiser] about what they were hoping to achieve with this meeting.'
    If appropriate, follow up afterwards with the organiser to offer support
    and suggest clearer facilitation tools (e.g., an agenda, timekeeper, or
    moderator) for future meetings.

- id: 6
  scenario: >
    A presenter or faciliator rushes through a check-in for questions or 
    understanding, without giving space for considered input
  advice: >
    Gently interrupt with: 'Before we move on, I'd appreciate a moment to reflect
    or ask questions â€” this is a lot to take in.' Or: 'Could we pause for a minute
    to let folks gather their thoughts?'
    TODO: move to a 'outer moments' section - If you're not comfortable speaking up in the moment, consider following up
    with the facilitator to encourage more intentional pauses or use of async
    feedback tools (e.g., chat, collaborative doc).
